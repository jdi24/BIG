esGLUT
======

esGLUT is a tiny GLUT implementation which initializes OpenGL-ES 2 as-well as
handle keyboard and mouse events.

esGLUT was first created to build a Windows emulator of the WebGL and GLUT
features supported by Emscripten (http://emscripten.org) ; as such it should
serve as a convenient base to build portable OpenGL-ES2/WebGL applications.

Binaries of OpenGL ES 2 for Windows are provided as pre-built binaries of the
Angleproject (http://code.google.com/p/angleproject/).

Precompiled samples can be found at: http://talansoft.com/muse/webgl/index.html
